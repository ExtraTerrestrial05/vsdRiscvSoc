## üõ†Ô∏è Toolchain & Environment
- Operating System: **Windows 11 (WSL - Ubuntu 20.04)**
- RISC-V GNU Toolchain (compiled locally for `rv32i`)
- Simulator: **QEMU (riscv32)**

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Toolchain Installation
The RISC-V GNU Toolchain was cloned and built from source targeting `rv32i` architecture using:

### ‚úÖ Task 2: Simple Test Program
A basic addition program (`mytest.c`) was compiled into `mytest.elf`. The ELF was dumped into assembly using `riscv32-unknown-elf-objdump`.

### ‚úÖ Task 3: Unique Test Case
A custom test (`unique_test.c`) involving multiplication and subtraction was created, compiled, and its assembly dump was generated similarly.

### ‚úÖ Task 4: Program Execution using QEMU
Due to **build issues with the Proxy Kernel (SPARK / pk)**, I was unable to simulate ELF files using Spike+pk.
However, I validated the execution of the compiled ELF files using **QEMU (riscv32 user-mode simulation)** to demonstrate correct program behavior.

Execution commands:

Screenshots of program execution are attached in the repository.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on SPARK (pk):
Despite multiple attempts to build **Proxy Kernel (pk)**, the compilation failed due to architecture limitations and missing multilib support.  
Given time constraints, **QEMU** was used as a valid alternative for RISC-V ELF execution.


## üìÑ Conclusion
All tasks regarding toolchain setup, test case compilation, assembly analysis, and program execution have been completed.  
Execution was validated using QEMU as a substitute for SPARK, ensuring functional correctness of compiled RISC-V programs.
